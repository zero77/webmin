<header>Certificate mapping</header>

The SNI certificate mapping file associates domain names with certificate
files, for use when Postfix receives an SMTP connection in SSL mode. The
format of the table is :

<ul>
<li><b>Hostname</b> - A hostname or wildcard like <tt>*.example.com</tt> to match the hostname in the SSL SNI connection against.

<li><b>Certificate files</b> - Path to a PEM format file containing the private key and certificate to use.
</ul>
